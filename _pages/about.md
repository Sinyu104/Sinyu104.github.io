<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of British Columbia (UBC), supervised by Prof. [Vincent Wong](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~vincentw/Homepage/Home.html). My research focuses on leveraging large language models to enhance wireless communication networks, with an emphasis on areas such as semantic communication and edge computing. Prior to joining UBC, I worked as a research assistant at the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, in 2023, under the supervision of Dr. [Chih-Yu Wang](https://homepage.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/cywang/index_en.html), where I studied phase shift design for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2021 and 2022, respectively. During my master's studies, I was supervised by Prof. [Kuang-Hao Liu](https://www.ee.nthu.edu.tw/khliu/) and focused on cooperative communications and the age of information (AoI) for IoT devices.

<!-- My past research interest includes RIS and cooperative communications.

[Leveraging MoE-based Large Language Model for Zero-Shot Multi-Task Semantic Communication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15722) in *Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)*, Montreal, Canada, Jun. 2025.

- In this work, we propose a semantic communication system that employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language model to support zero-shot multi-task transmission. The transmitter encodes source data into semantic representations conditioned on the receiver‚Äôs task prompt, while the MoE architecture selectively activates expert modules for efficient adaptation. Experiments show that the proposed system outperforms standard dense models in zero-shot multi-task semantic communication scenarios.

[Presenter at ICC 2025](https://icc2025.ieee-icc.org/)
8‚Äì12 June, Montreal, Canada


- I presented my work ‚ÄúLeveraging MoE-based Large Language Model for Zero-Shot Multi-Task Semantic Communication‚Äù at IEEE ICC 2025. The paper introduces a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLM framework for zero-shot, task-oriented semantic communication across multiple tasks without fine-tuning. It shows how foundation models can enable flexible and efficient communication in dynamic wireless environments. I also enjoyed connecting with researchers in AI-driven wireless systems. It was a truly inspiring experience.

[Student Voluteer in INFOCOM 2024](https://infocom2024.ieee-infocom.org)
20‚Äì23 May, Vancouver, Canada


- During INFOCOM 2024, I had the opportunity to serve as a student volunteer. I facilitated virtual presentations via Zoom, ensuring smooth transitions between speakers and resolving any technical issues. Additionally, I assisted with in-person duties such as working at the registration desk, where I greeted attendees and provided information, and checking badges during key events to maintain security and order. This experience enhanced my organizational and communication skills while giving me valuable insight into event coordination in a large-scale academic conference.
