<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of British Columbia (UBC), supervised by Prof. [Vincent Wong](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~vincentw/Homepage/Home.html). My research focuses on leveraging large language models to enhance wireless communication networks, with an emphasis on areas such as semantic communication and edge computing. Prior to joining UBC, I worked as a research assistant at the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, in 2023, under the supervision of Dr. [Chih-Yu Wang](https://homepage.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/cywang/index_en.html), where I studied phase shift design for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2021 and 2022, respectively. During my master's studies, I was supervised by Prof. [Kuang-Hao Liu](https://www.ee.nthu.edu.tw/khliu/) and focused on cooperative communications and the age of information (AoI) for IoT devices.

My past research interest includes RIS and cooperative communications. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=epYiVosAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=epYiVosAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

[Relay selection for energy harvesting relays with energy prioritization and inter-relay charging](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9805690)
in *IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology*, vol. 71, no. 10, pp. 10646-10655, Oct. 2022

**Sin-Yu Huang**, Kuang-Hao Liu


- In this work, we propose a relay selection scheme for buffer-aided relays that store the received signal in a finite data buffer and accumulate the energy harvested from RF signals in a finite energy storage. In the proposed scheme, relays are prioritized according to their instantaneous energy and data buffer status as well as channel conditions reported by relays. The performance of the proposed relay selection scheme is theoretically analyzed using a discrete-time Markov chain and show the superiority of the proposed relay selection scheme than the state-of-art.

[Student Voluteer in INFOCOM](https://infocom2024.ieee-infocom.org)
20‚Äì23 May 2024, Vancouver, Canada


- During INFOCOM 2024, I had the opportunity to serve as a student volunteer. I facilitated virtual presentations via Zoom, ensuring smooth transitions between speakers and resolving any technical issues. Additionally, I assisted with in-person duties such as working at the registration desk, where I greeted attendees and provided information, and checking badges during key events to maintain security and order. This experience enhanced my organizational and communication skills while giving me valuable insight into event coordination in a large-scale academic conference.
